							<h2>Windows Active Directory.</h2>
						</header>
						  <p>An active directory is a network of machines and servers controlled by a single domain controller.</p>
						  <p><strong>Users -</strong> four key types of user: Domain Admin they have acess to the domain controller, Service Accounts generally used for maintenance, Local Administrators can control local machine but not the access the domain controller, Domain Users the everyday users.</p>
						  <p><strong>Groups -</strong> by organising users and objects in to groups it is easier to assign persmissions, while two main groups exist Security and Distribution the security groups are most important as distribution is mostly about email lists. Windows offers a lot of default security groups.</p>
              <p><stong>Domain Trusts/Policies -</strong>. two types of trust determine how the domains communicate: Directional - from the a trusting domain to a trusted domain, Transitive the trust relationship expands beyond just two domains. Policies are a set of rules that can be modified and created by domain admins.</p>
              <p><strong>Domain Services -</strong> the services that the domain controller provides to the rest of the domian. Default services include: Lightweight Directory Access Protocal LDAP provides communication btween applications and directory services, Certificate Services allow the controller to create, validate and revoke key certificates and Domain Name Services for identifying IP hostnames.</p>
              <p><strong>Domain Authentication -</strong> two main types of authenticication: Kerberos the default ticket granting service and NTLM the protocol for encryted challenge/response protocol.</p>
            <p><strong>Cloud Services -</strong> most notable cloud provider is Azure AD, its default setting are much more secure than standard on-site Active Directory. Asure acts as the middle man between the physical AD and the cloud.<p>
