				<!-- One -->
					<section id="one">
						<header class="major">
							<h2>The Python Programing Language.</h2>
						</header>
						<p>This will refer to Python 3 version. Python is a simple language with less need to understand memory management than C. Python uses indentation rather than the {} blocks we see in other languages, this tends to makes the documents somewhat full of white space!</p>
					</section>

				<!-- Two -->
					<section id="two">
						<h2>Basic Structure - hello world</h2>
						
				  	</section>
        
        			<!-- Three -->
					<section id="three">
						<h2>Variables</h2>
						<p>Python does not require you to declare variables before using them, or even to declare the variable type.</br>
						<strong>a = 7</strong> declares the variable a as an interger because it is given an integer with the value 3.</br>
						<strong>a = 4.5</strong> declares the variable a as a float as it recieved a float value 4.5. Or you can use a = float(7).</br>
						<strong>a = "hello"</strong> declares the variable a as a string and it recieved the string value hello.</br>
						Lists are similar to arrays, <strong>alist = []</strong> alist.append(1) will add a value to alist and a = alist[0] will set a to the value in the first possition in the list.</p>
          				</section>		
				
				<!-- Four -->
					<section id="four">
						<h2>Looping</h2>
						<p>For loops - <strong>for a in numbers:></strong> this will iterate through the list numbers setting a to each one in turn.</p>
						<p>While loops - <strong>n = 0 while n < 10: code block, followed by n += 1</strong> this will loop 10 times.</p>
						<p>break and continue will work on both types of loop break ending the loop and continue skipping the following statements.</p>
						<p>else can be used to catch the end of a loop but will not be triggered by a break statement</p>
							
        				</section>

				<!-- Five -->
					<section id="five">
						<h2>Functions</h2>
						<p>Functions take a number of inputs and returns one or more values. A function must be declared using the def statementbefore they are used either in a header file or in the begining of the C file.</p>
						<p>Declaration <strong>def this_function(): code block with a possible return</strong>. If the function is not ment to return a value the it is declared as a void and no return is required.</p>
						<p>Scope, a function is considered local and when it is complete any variables inside it are lost, however you can add Static to the function.</p>
