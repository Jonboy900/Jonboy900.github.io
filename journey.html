						<h2>Pen Testing</h2>
						<p><strong>Methodology for Pen Testing</strong> this can be broken down into a five step plan.</p>
						<p><strong>1 - Information Gathering</strong> this covers a range of open source research that might include examining web sites, social media or public records. None of this stage involves any hacking.</p>
						<p><strong>2 - Enumeration/Scanning</strong> an investigation of applications and services that are running on the target system.</p>
						<p><strong>3 - Exploitation</strong> finding and using vulnerabilities that exist on the on system its applications and services.</p>
						<p><strong>4 - Privilege Escalation</strong> with a foothold established then try to escalate the access via moving horizontally into use accounts of the same access level or vertically into another level of permisions  group.</p>
						<p><strong>5 - Post Exploitation</strong> what else can achieved, additional information, further host exploitation or access to wider systems. Then the tester may wish to cover the tracks of the penetration removing files and even altering logs. The final stage is the reporting of the steps taken to gain access to a system so that the system owners can improve the security.</p>
						<p>The following simulated penetration is against the Try Hack Me room - Basic Pen testing.</p>
						<p>Starting with an <a href="ip.html">IP address</a> we can establish that we have a basic machine responding with a Ping test.</p>
						<p>Next a network mapper <a href="nmap.html">Nmap</a> can be deployed to see what ports are responding and what sort of services are running on the machine.</p>
						<p>On seeing a http service running on a port we can try inspecting this simply by browsing to the IP address.</p>
						<p>Looking behind the web site by exposing the code using web developer tools found in most browsers, this will also show the comments which might expose some more information.</p>
						<p>Drib can be used to expose some more information, it will scan for hidden directories by scanning common file paths.</p>
						<p>With this information we can browse to look at any hidden directories.</p>
						<p><a href="enum.html">Enum4linux</a> can be deployed to see what else can be discovered, in this case the user names were discovered.</p>
						<p><a href="hydra.html">Hydra</a> can be used to break simple passwords with a brute force approach using a password list like rockyou.txt.</p>
						<p>Once a user name and password have been discovered we can use SSH to login to that machine. More info on SSH can be found on the  <a href="linux.html">Linux page</a>.</p>
						<p>Once inside with a shell we can have a look around using <a href="linux.html">Linux Bash</a> commands like; cd, ls and cat to see what can be found.</p>
						<p>In this case we found a private key that had been encrypted for another user. To attempt breaking an Encryption john the ripper will attempt break the encryption for us.</p>
						<p>With the encrypted password now broken we can try gaining access as that user.</p>
						<p>This covered a range of tools that are all part of the pen tested toolbox that helped provide access to the machine starting with just an IP address, more info on the tools I encountered will be found in the various links.</p>

						<h2>Common Vulnerabilities</h2>
						<p><strong>CVE's -</strong> Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. A single unique identifier for a vulnarability these are used by a number of organisation and details the common knowledge about a vurnerability. <a href="metasploit.html">Metasploit</a> the framework for searching and using CVE's. Metasploit is split in to several moduals: to look at a system for a weakness, exploit that weakness, modify an attack to hide it. Given a CVE number you can search Metasploit to look at the vurnerability and gain information on the exploit and even how sucessful the exploit has been. The strength of Metasploit is to link all the elements together so while running a system scam using Nmap wih in Metasploit the data will populate the Metasploit database looking up exploits as we see system data.</p>
						<p>The following simulated penetration is against the Try Hack Me room - Bolt.</p>
						<p>A good habit is recording the steps taken in a file.</p>
						<p>With Metasploit running "msfconsole" to start, we ran a Nmap of the system with "db nmap (target ip)" to get a view of what running on the traget system and we can see a bolt server running on port 8000.</p>
						<p>Taking a look around at the web page with "target_ip:8000" we can see that they have left a password and a user name on the blog pages.<
						<p>By logging in with the above details we can find the version number of the Bolt server. We can now search the Metaspoilt for the exploits available for Bolt "search bolt" will show us 2 CVE's and looking at these we can get some more info with "info exploit name".</p>
						<p>From the above information we can see what the variables are we will need to set to use this exploit, set LHOST, set RHOST ectra. Note you will need to be in the exploit module of msfconsole.</p>
						<p>With in metasploit exploit and having chosen our exploit and set the variables we can now "run" the exploit to gain a reverse shell.</p>
