						<h2>Pen Testing</h2>
						<p><strong>Methodology for Pen Testing</strong> this can be broken down into a five step plan.</p>
						<p><strong>1 - Information Gathering</strong> this covers a range of open source research that might include examining web sites, social media or public records. None of this stage involves any hacking.</p>
						<p><strong>2 - Enumeration/Scanning</strong> an investigation of applications and services that are running on the target system.</p>
						<p><strong>3 - Exploitation</strong> finding and using vulnerabilities that exist on the on system its applications and services.</p>
						<p><strong>4 - Privilege Escalation</strong> with a foothold established then try to escalate the access via moving horizontally into use accounts of the same access level or vertically into another level of permissions group.</p>
						<p><strong>5 - Post Exploitation</strong> what else can achieved, additional information, further host exploitation or access to wider systems. Then the tester may wish to cover the tracks of the penetration removing files and even altering logs. The final stage is the reporting of the steps taken to gain access to a system so that the system owners can improve the security.</p>
						<p>The following simulated penetration is against the Try Hack Me room - Basic Pen testing.</p>
						<p>Starting with an <a href="ip.html">IP address</a> we can establish that we have a basic machine responding with a Ping test.</p>
						<p>Next a network mapper <a href="nmap.html">Nmap</a> can be deployed to see what ports are responding and what sort of services are running on the machine.</p>
						<p>On seeing a http service running on a port we can try inspecting this simply by browsing to the IP address.</p>
						<p>Looking behind the web site by exposing the code using web developer tools found in most browsers, this will also show the comments which might expose some more information.</p>
						<p>Drib can be used to expose some more information, it will scan for hidden directories by scanning common file paths.</p>
						<p>With this information we can browse to look at any hidden directories.</p>
						<p><a href="enum.html">Enum4linux</a> can be deployed to see what else can be discovered, in this case the user names were discovered.</p>
						<p><a href="hydra.html">Hydra</a> can be used to break simple passwords with a brute force approach using a password list like rockyou.txt.</p>
						<p>Once a user name and password have been discovered we can use SSH to login to that machine. More info on SSH can be found on the  <a href="linux.html">Linux page</a>.</p>
						<p>Once inside with a shell we can have a look around using <a href="linux.html">Linux Bash</a> commands like; cd, ls and cat to see what can be found.</p>
						<p>In this case we found a private key that had been encrypted for another user. To attempt breaking an Encryption john the ripper will attempt break the encryption for us.</p>
						<p>With the encrypted password now broken we can try gaining access as that user.</p>
						<p>This covered a range of tools that are all part of the pen tested toolbox that helped provide access to the machine starting with just an IP address, more info on the tools I encountered will be found in the various links.</p>

						<h2>Common Vulnerabilities</h2>
						<p><strong>CVE's -</strong> Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. A single unique identifier for a vulnerability these are used by a number of organisation and details the common knowledge about a vulnerability. <a href="metasploit.html">Metasploit</a> the framework for searching and using CVE's. Metasploit is split in to several modules: to look at a system for a weakness, exploit that weakness, modify an attack to hide it. Given a CVE number you can search Metasploit to look at the vulnerability and gain information on the exploit and even how successful the exploit has been. The strength of Metasploit is to link all the elements together so while running a system scam using Nmap within Metasploit the data will populate the Metasploit database looking up exploits as we see the system data.</p>
						<p>The following simulated penetration is against the Try Hack Me room - Bolt.</p>
						<p>A good habit is recording the steps taken in a file.</p>
						<p>With Metasploit running "msfconsole" to start, we ran a Nmap of the system with "db nmap (target ip)" to get a view of what running on the target system and we can see a bolt server running on port 8000.</p>
						<p>Taking a look around at the web page with "target_ip:8000" we can see that they have left a password and a user name on the blog pages.<
						<p>By logging in with the above details we can find the version number of the Bolt server. We can now search the Metaspoilt for the exploits available for Bolt "search bolt" will show us 2 CVE's and looking at these we can get some more info with "info exploit name".</p>
						<p>From the above information we can see what the variables are we will need to set to use this exploit, set LHOST, set RHOST ectra. Note you will need to be in the exploit module of msfconsole.</p>
						<p>Within metasploit exploit and having chosen our exploit and set the variables we can now "run" the exploit to gain a reverse shell.</p>

						<h2>Malware Analysis</h2>
						<p><strong>File analysis -</strong> Examining malware to see what it is doing. We might have identified a file that is suspicious and without running it what can we find out.</p>
						<p>Understanding malware this can be broken down into two main categories targeted and mass campaigns. Stuxnet was spread far and wide looking like a mass campaigns however it was looking for a particular device in Iran only fired its payload when it found that system. Wannacry was an example of a wide spread attack using the eternal blue exploit.</p>
						<p>While examining malware we can consider the delivery method, the execution, how it maintains persistence and how it propagates across systems.</p>
						<p>Delivery was it on a compromised USB stick or as an attachment in a phishing attack.</p>
						<p>Execution is it encrypting files, is it recording information like keystrokes it is Spyware.</p>
						<p>Maintaining Persistence if it killed by just restarting your machine then its not much of a malware but what is it doing to maintain its presence.</p>
						<p>Propagation if you can infect one machine what can the malware do to infect further devices.</p>
						<p>Signatures are a commonly used method of identified malware, if the malware has already been identified then the file signature might tell us if it is a virus.</p>
						<p>Another way of looking for malware is to look for activity outside of the normal this might be network traffic.</p>
						<p>Analysis of a file can be carried out in two distinct methods Static and Dynamic. Static will not involve running the code while Dynamic will run the file in a safe environment.</p>
						<p><strong>Static Analysis -</strong> a few of the tools that can be deployed for static analysis.</p>
						<p>MD5 checksums these are a cryptographic fingerprint of the file so we can check the checksum of a file on websites like "Virustotal" to see if the MD5 has already been identified as a virus. The tool "HashTab" tool which will calculate the files MD5 sum directly within Window explorer this MD5 checksum can simple be checked with "Virustotal".</p>
						<p>Virustotal is capable for looking at files URLs or hashes and informing you of what it knows about that file. It can give the real name of the file, the authors of the file, the actions that the file might carry out. Virustotal draws on a wide range of sources for its information and this spread of information will give us a very good idea about the reliability of the data.</p>
						<p><strong>Obfuscation/Packing -</strong>  There are legitimate and malicious reasons as to why you might want to prevent decompiling of their code. The "PeID" tool will identify the packer used. "IDA Freeware" tool can be used to disassemble the code however a packed file will give us little information.</p>
						<p><strong>Strings -</strong> By looking at the ASCII text strings in a program we can learn something about what it might be doing. Windows has a tool for this "PE Explorer".</p>
						<p><strong>Dynamic Analysis -</strong> at this point I have not carried out any dynamic analysis.</p>
