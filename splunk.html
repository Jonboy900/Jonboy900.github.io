							<h2>Splunk.</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Capable of collecting the data from a wide range of devices structuring that data and then placing it is database. This can allow real time monitoring of large amounts of systems data to generate alerts. It also provides a quickly searchable record of what happened for event analysis.</p>
						<p><strong>Splunk Apps -</strong> Splunk is divided into a number of apps with the Search App being installed as default but many more can be added as required.</p>

					<section id="two">
						<h2>Data</h2>
						<p>A wide variety of machines produce a lot of data from system logs, TCP handshakes and many more, the problem with this data is that each part of it is generally in a different format. Splunk takes this data and gives it some common structure and then places it in a Database that is searchable creating something that can be monitored in real time or examined retrospectively  to see what occurred. Once set up these parts need little user interaction.</p>
						<p><strong>Setting the data source -</strong> it maybe necessary to set the data source we are going to use this is done with index=???. The time frame will also require setting as the default is the last 24 hours.</p>
					</section>
				
				<!-- Three -->
					<section id="three">
						<h2>Searches</h2>
						<p>The power of Splunk is in its ability to refine down this large data set via the search options.</p>
						<p><strong>Search Processing Language -</strong> a series of commands and arguments chained to gether with a pipe (|) command so that the output of the first search part is then fed to the second search command and so on. Search commands are used to filter unwanted events, extract more information, calculate values, transform, and statistically analyze the indexed data.</p>
						<p><strong>Implied And -</strong> splunk uses an implied and in its queries. Example "sourcetype=access AND error" need only be writen as "sourcetype=access error".</p>
						<p><strong>Exploring the results of a search -</strong> once a search has been carried out an often large table of results will be avialble so we can futher explore the data. By selecting the interesting fields and looking at a breakdown of the number of events by that type. When we find one that works for us we can add this to the search criteria.</p>

						<h2>Stats</h2>
						<p>Rather than looking a large number of results from a search .</p>
					</section>
				
				<!-- Five -->
					<section id="five">
						<h2>Reports, Alerts & Dashboards</h2>
						<p>Based on pre built searches you can build reports to be output say each day showing some activity.</p>
						<p>Alerts are a real time report system where you can create alerts based on when something happens.</p>
						<p>Dashboards - this allows real time data to be displayed allowing defence teams to observe what is going on on the system in a visually consumable way.</p>
