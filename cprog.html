							<h2>The C Programing Language.</h2>
						</header>
						<p>C is one the fundamental programming languages and underlies many other things. It relates closely to the way machines work specifically with relation to memory managment</p>
					</section>

				<!-- Two -->
					<section id="two">
						<h2>Basic Structure - hello world</h2>
						<p><strong>#include stdio.h</strong> A call to include a header file with a libary of functions in the stdio need to be surounded by diamond brackets.</br>
						<strong>int main()</strong> The main program call which will return an int (0=good).</br>
						<strong>{</strong> Curlly brackets enclose a block of code</br>
						<strong>printf("hello world");</strong> A call to printf function with the text note a line must end with a ;</br>
						<strong>return 0;</strong> This returns the value 0 as the function main closes. ,/br>
						<strong>}</strong> A curlly bracket to end block of code</p>
					</section>
        
        			<!-- Three -->
					<section id="three">
						<h2>Variables</h2>
						<p>C needs to know what type a variable is so it can reserve the corect amount of space for it.</br>
						<strong>int a = 3;</strong> declares the variable a as an interger with the value 3.</br>
						<strong>float b = 4.5;</strong> declares the variable b as a float with the value 4.5.</br>
						<strong>int numbers[10];</strong> an array of 10 integers acessed by the number[0] to number[9].</br>
						<strong>char letters[2][4];</strong> a two dimensional array of characters 2 rows and 4 columns, letters[0][0] = a.</br>
						strings are an array of characters with a terminating character.</br>
						<strong>char name[] = "Jon Hicks";</strong> an array of 10 characters the extra one is a terminating character.</p>
						</p>Scope of variables can be local (they are only aviailable with in this section of code, Static available within this file, or Global which makes them available to all section of the program.</p>
        				</section>
				
				<!-- Four -->
					<section id="four">
						<h2>Looping</h2>
						<p>For loops - <strong>int i; for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {code block}</strong> this will set the counter i to 0 test if i has reached 10 and increment i so doing the code block 10 times.</p>
						<p>While loops - <strong>int n = 0; while (n < 10) {code block, followed by n++;}</strong> while this is the same as above we also have some other commands available break; will cause the loop to end and continue; will cause a section to be skipped.</p>
							
        				</section>

				<!-- Five -->
					<section id="five">
						<h2>Functions</h2>
						<p>In C functions are simple, they take a number of inputs and return one value or none. A function must be declared before they are used either in a header file or in the begining of the C file.</p>
						<p>Declaration <strong>int this_function(int incoming_value) {code block with a return var}</strong>. If the function is not ment to return a value the it is declared as a void and no return is required.</p>
						<p>Scope, a function is considered local and when it is complete any variables inside it are lost, however you can add Static to the function.</p>	
        				</section>

				<!-- Six -->
					<section id="six">
						<h2>Pointers</h2>
						<p>Pointers are used to directly point to a part of memory. That part of memory usually holds a variable, we can assign a pointer to a variable by <strong>*pointer_to_var = & var;</strong> we can then increment var with <strong> *pointer_to_var += 1;</strong> and what is stored at *pointer_to_var is increased by one.</p>
        				</section>
				<!-- Seven -->
					<section id="seven">
						<h2>Structures</h2>
						<p>Structures contain a set of variables, a structure needs to be declared before it is used.</br>
						struct name {</br>
						   int x;</br>
						   int y; }</br>
						To create a variable of type structure we can set it with struct name coord; To address the variable inside a structure we use the dot so coord.x = 10; We can pass a structure to a function draw(coord).</p>
						<p>Typedefs improve the naming of structures</br>
						typedef struct {</br>
						int x;</br>
						int y;</br>
						} point;</br>
						Now we can decare a new variable of type point by saying point p;</p>
						<p>Lastly We can include pointers in a structure allowing strings to be passed.</p>
					</section>
				<!-- Eight -->
					<section id="eight">
						<h2>Function arguments by reference</h2>
						<p>As Functions make copies of the variables and do not reference the original variable but if we pass the pointer to the variable instead we can alter the original variable.</br>
						void addone(int *n) {</br>
						(*n)++; }</br>
						addone(&n); This passes the pointer to n and will add one to the original variable n in the greater scope.</p>
        					<p>We can pass a pointer to structure and then alter the original variables with the following:</br>
						void move(point * p) {</br>
						p->x++; } </p>
					</section>
