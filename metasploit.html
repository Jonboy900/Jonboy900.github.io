							<h2>Metasploit.</h2>
						</header>
						<p>A collection of tested exploits with an extended set of tools used to identify vulnerabilities on servers and networks. The tools are divided into some separate sections and you can background these sessions with CTRL Z to allow you to jump into other parts. Sessions will list the open sessions for you and sessions -i # will take you back to the specified session.</p>
					</section>

				<!-- Two -->
					<section id="two">
						<h2>Suits of tools - modules</h2>
						<p><strong>Exploit -</strong> for taking advantage of weakness in a target system.</p>
						<p><strong>Payload -</strong> a set of codes which can be run after exploiting and weakness in a system.</p>
						<p><strong>Encoder -</strong> this will allow us to set the exploits.</p>
						<p><strong>Listeners -</strong> .<p>
						<p><strong>NOP -</strong> this is no operation tasks.</p>
						<p><strong>Auxiliary -</strong> An extended set of further tools.</p>
            					<p><strong>Post -</strong> for post exploitation including gaining further information on a target system.</p>
					</section>
				
				<!-- Three -->
					<section id="three">
						<h2>Commands</h2>
						<p><strong>start Metasploit -</strong> use the msfconsole command.</p>
						<p><strong>initialize the data base -</strong> use the msfdb init command and db_status to check the database connection.</p>
						<p><strong>help or ? -</strong> to bring up the menu of available commands.</p>
						<p><strong>connect -</strong> to make a quick connection with a host to verify that we can talk with it.</p>
						<p><strong>db_nmap -</strong> to run an Nmap (add the flags you want) to map ports and services.</p>
						<p><strong>search -</strong> to look for an exploit, usage search "exploit_name" name must be in double quotes.</p>
						<p><strong>use -</strong> to use an exploit (not actually to run it) but so that we can set the variables we might need to run it and to find out more about it. Usage use #.</p>
						<p><strong>info -</strong> about the current module selected or a specific one, this will give a report on what variables need to be set to use an exploit.</p>
						<p><strong>set -</strong> to set the variables in the exploit. Usage VARIABLENAME value</p>						
						<p><strong>get -</strong> will show a variable named.</p>
						<p><strong>run -</strong> to run an exploit with the variables set.</p>

						<h2>Simple Example - Bolt on THM</h2>
						<p><strong>msfconsole -</strong> to start using metasploit.</p>
						<p><strong>db_nmap -sV (target IP) -</strong> to get a map of the ports and services running. Port 8000 is open and looks like a web server.</p>
						<p><strong>Browse the web site -</strong> navigate to (target IP):8000 and have a look around we can get the admin name and password in blogs here as well as seeing that the CMS is Bolt.</p>
						<p><strong>Try and login -</strong> need to find the login page. Google bolt cms to find default login page. Browse to (target IP):8000/bolt and login with admin name and password note can see version of Bolt running here.</p>
						<p><strong>search bolt in metasploit -</strong> to look for any known exploits, this returns 2 known exploits including the exploit/path name and which versions of Bolt they work on.</p>
						<p><strong>info (exploit/path) -</strong> will give us a lot of information on how to use this and provide the EDB-ID of the exploit is we want to look for more info on this exploit.</p>
						<p><strong>use (exploit/path) -</strong> this will set us to using the exploit part of metasploit. Now we will need to set some variables LHOST (that is our attack box) RHOST (target machine) USERNAME and PASSWORD.</p>
						<p><strong>set (VAR value) -</strong> to set up the variables.</p>
						<p><strong>run -</strong> will start the exploit with the variables we have set and if successful will create a shell for us.</p>
						<p><strong>Bash commands to look around -</strong> ls, pwd, help, cd/home, ls and cat (filename) will all be useful here to find the flag.</p>
