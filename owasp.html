							<h2>OWASP Top Ten.</h2>
						</header>
						<p>This identifies and ranks the most critical security risks to web application. At time of writing this refenences the 2021 tables.</p>
					</section>

					<section id="two">
						<h2>1 - Broken Access Control</h2>
						<p>This covers the password login authenticication system. Brute force attacks with mulipule attempts can be stopped with auto lockouts after a certain number of attempts. Weak credentials and common passwords can be improved by enforcing a strong password policy. Weak session cookies can be mitigated with multi factor authenticication.</p>

					<section id="three">
						<h2>2 - Crytographic Failures</h2>
						<p>Previously known as Sensitive Data Exposure, this covers a range of data that is exposed when a webapp ends up giving it away possibly make the database available or by failing to encrypt or weakly encrypting the data when transmiting it.</p>
        				</section>
        
        			<!-- Four -->
					<section id="four">
						<h2>3 - Injection</h2>
						<p>Where user controlled input is interpreted as actual commands or parameters by the application. SQL injection occurs when input is passed to a query, this can allow an attacker to access, modify or delete data in a database. Command Injection is when user input is passed allowing execution of system commands. To defend against this the input data needs to be cleaned or restricted.</p>

        			<!-- Five -->
					<section id="five">
						<h2>4 - Insecure Design</h2>
						<p>This new category relates to design and architectural flaws. This requires a change in the coding of programs and systems rather than patching it up afterwards. Security needs to be built into the design process and not an add-on to the software.</p>
        				</section>
        
        			<!-- Six -->
					<section id="six">
						<h2>5 - Security Misconfiguation</h2>
						<p>This now includes XML External Entity attack (XXE). XML is the markup for cross platform delivery, used for storing and transporting data. It is possible to get xml to perform a read opperation when it is read on the target machine, this provides an opportunity for the target machine to display data that it was not meant to have displayed </p>
