							<h2>Linux.</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Many different versions of Linux can be found however at the core of all of them is the terminal and the Bash shell. A shell can be described as a piece of code which can be used to gain code or command execution on a device, a reverse shell is a type of shell with the target machine communicating back to the attacking machine. All Linux variants come with this. The format of the commands is usually (command -option argument). Some of the commands are detailed below.</p>
						<p><strong>SSH -</strong> Secure Shell Protocol, is a remote administration protocol that allows users to access, control, and modify their remote servers over the internet. Usage ssh name@IP. To copy a file in SSH use scp file.txt remote_username@10.10.0.2:/remote/directory.</p>
						<p><strong>SMB -</strong> Server Message Block Protocol, a communication protocol for sharing access to files, printers, ectra on windows. The SMB protocol is a response-request protocol with multiple messages between client and server to establish a connection. Once the connection is established client can then send commands (SMB's) to the server to access files. SMB services can be discovered using <a href="nmap.html">NMap</a>.</p>
						<p><stong>SAMBA -</strong> a suite of programs for Linus that allows end users access SMB.</p>
						<p>Smbclient, to access an SMB share, Syntax smbclient //[IP]/[sharename] -U [username] -p[port].</p>

						<h2>Bash Commands</h2>
						<p><strong>pwd -</strong> displays the current working directory.</p>
						<p><strong>cd -</strong> change directory allows us to move around the file structure. (/directory_name) moves us down. (..) moves us to the home directory.</p>
						<p><strong>ls -</strong> lists file and sub directories. (-a) allow us to see all files including hidden. (-l) add user groups and ownership to the list. (-t) will sort the output by created or last used. Note that directory names that contain a space must be enclosed in quotes</p>
						<p><strong>mkdir -</strong> adds a new sub directory to your current location. You can also specify the full path of the directory you want to make (/home/username/newdir.</p>
						<p><strong>rmdir -</strong> removes a directory. (-ri) will also remove any files in the directory asking for conformation for each one. (-r) will remove all the files without asking for conformation.</p>
						<p><strong>mv -</strong> renames a file you must specify current name and the name you want to change it to. mv can also move a file by specifying the file name and the subdirectory.</p>
						<p><strong>cp -</strong> will copy a file you must specify the file name and the sub directory name.</p>
            					<p><strong>rm -</strong> will remove or delete files by naming them or (*) to delete all files in the directory.</p>
            					<p><strong>ln -</strong> will create links to the file either hard they will retain a copy of the file if it is deleted or soft in which case they will not retain a copy. Usage ln root/somedir/some.file hardlink or softlink.</p>
            					<p><strong>stat -</strong> will show the attributes of a file.</p>
            					<p><strong>du -b -</strong> will show the size of a file in bytes.</p>
            					<p><strong>wc -</strong> will show the line count of a file and (-m) will give the word count .</p>
            					<p><strong>touch -</strong> can be used to change the date and time stamps of a file.</p>
            					<p><strong>cmp -</strong> compares two file if they are identical it will report nothing if some difference exists it will report only the first occurrence of a difference.</p>
            					<p><strong>comm -</strong> this will produce a line by line comparison in three columns (only in first file/only in second file/in both files).</p>
            					<p><strong>diff -</strong> again this will compare to files but can also be used to compare two directories.</p>
            					<p><strong>find -</strong> Example find DirectoryName -type f -name FileName. The DirectoryName is the starting point in the file structure, -type f tells us we are searching for a file -name is the file we are looking for. This command has a lot of options available.</p>
            					<p><strong>cat -</strong> Displays the content of one or more text files. (| less) will page the output if it is to long to read in one go.</p>
