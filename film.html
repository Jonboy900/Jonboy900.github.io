						<h2>History</h2>
						<p><strong>Early Involvement -</strong> I crossed over from my time as a lightning designer in threate to working on a range of film and TV productions.</p>
						<p><strong>Second time around -</strong> Having undertaken my degree in Systems Analysis and around the time that the first Non-linear edit suits appeared I was head hunted back to the film industry.</p>
						<p><strong>IPCA -</strong> This company was undertaking one of the largest documentary projects ever undertaken and generated a huge amount of archive material that was was far to much to handle for the directors editing the films. I was tasked with the development of an image data base to service this.</p>
						<p><strong>Production Manager -</strong> From this point on I became far more involved in the documentary production with up to 5 35mm film crews working just about anywhere on the planet.</p>
						<p><strong>Facilities Manager -</strong> After the time with IPCA I was head hunted to set up and develop post productions facilities in both KSA and Dubia. Working with a large team we established film/editing and production facilites.</p>
            <p><strong>Producer/Director -</strong> During this time I became involved in the making of Commericals for the Middle East market specialising in making 4wheel drive car commercials.</p>
