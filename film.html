					<h2>History</h2>
					<p><strong>Early Involvement -</strong> I crossed over from my time as a lightning designer in theatre to working on a range of film and TV productions.</p>
					<p><strong>Second time around -</strong> Having undertaken my degree in Systems Analysis and around the time that the first Non-linear edit suits appeared I was head hunted back to the film industry to provide a working knowledge of current computer systems and the film industry.</p>
					<p><strong>IPCA -</strong> The company was undertaking one of the largest documentary projects ever carried out and generated a huge amount of archive material. It was far too much material to handle for the directors editing the films. I was tasked with the development of an image data base to service this.</p>
					<p><strong>Production Manager -</strong> From this point on I became far more involved in the documentary production with up to 5 35mm film crews working just about anywhere on the planet at the same time.</p>
					<p><strong>Facilities Manager -</strong> After the time with IPCA I was head hunted to set up and develop some productions facilities in both KSA and Dubai. Working with a large team we established 35mm film location services and production editing facilities along with studio and outside broadcast units.</p>
            				<p><strong>Producer/Director -</strong> During this time I became involved in the making of TV commercials for the diverse Middle East market specialising in making 4wheel drive car commercials. My love of diving lead to the production of an Underwater Series on Arabia.</p>
